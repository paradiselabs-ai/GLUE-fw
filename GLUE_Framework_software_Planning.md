# GLUE Framework MCP Planning Summary

---

## Planning Goal

Enhance GLUE Framework based on deep analysis recommendations.

---

## Todos

### 1. Implement fine-grained knowledge sharing controls (Complexity: 5)
Design and implement access policies, opt-in/opt-out controls, and audit logs to manage knowledge sharing granularity across teams and adhesives.

### 2. Improve DSL validation and CLI usability (Complexity: 5)
Enhance the DSL parser with schema validation, better error handling, and consider parser generators. Improve CLI with interactive wizards, contextual help, and onboarding flows.

### 3. Expand provider integrations (Complexity: 4)
Integrate additional LLM and tool providers such as Azure, AWS, HuggingFace, and others to increase framework flexibility.

### 4. Optimize vector database scaling (Complexity: 6)
Implement sharding, caching, and tiered storage strategies to handle large-scale vector data efficiently and cost-effectively.

### 5. Enable runtime dynamic tool creation (Complexity: 7)
Develop APIs and UI components that allow agents and users to create, modify, and share tools dynamically during execution, with validation and security checks.

### 6. Add enterprise admin features (Complexity: 6)
Develop dashboards, access controls, compliance tools, monitoring, and audit trails to support enterprise deployment and management.

### 7. Refine self-learning tuning (Complexity: 6)
Incorporate human feedback, adjustable reward functions, and conflict resolution strategies to improve agent learning and avoid suboptimal behaviors.

### 8. Support richer magnetic flow policies (Complexity: 5)
Implement conditional, time-based, and priority-based magnetic flows to enable more flexible and realistic team collaboration workflows.
