Yes, the prompt includes a mechanism related to creating MCP servers, although not a single, direct "create_mcp_server" tool.

Here's how it's handled:

1.  **`load_mcp_documentation` Tool:** This tool is specifically designed for situations where the user asks to create or install an MCP server (or asks to "add a tool" that would require a new server).
    *   **Description:** "Load documentation about creating MCP servers. This tool should be used when the user requests to create or install an MCP server... The documentation provides detailed information about the MCP server creation process, including setup instructions, best practices, and examples."

2.  **Process Implied:** The workflow for creating an MCP server would likely involve:
    *   The user asking to create a new tool/server.
    *   You using the `<load_mcp_documentation>` tool to get the instructions.
    *   Based on the documentation provided in the response, you would then use other tools (like `write_to_file` to create necessary code/configuration files and potentially `execute_command` to run setup scripts or commands) to actually build and configure the new MCP server.
    *   The prompt description for `load_mcp_documentation` explicitly mentions this scenario: "...to create an MCP server that provides tools and resources... You have the ability to create an MCP server and add it to a configuration file that will then expose the tools and resources for you to use..."

So, while there isn't one command `create_mcp`, the **capability exists** through the `load_mcp_documentation` tool combined with other general-purpose tools like file writing and command execution, guided by the retrieved documentation.
