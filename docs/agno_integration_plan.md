Here's a detailed development/refactoring plan for integrating Agno into GLUE, prioritizing steps based on importance and dependencies, and emphasizing a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

Phase 1: Core Integration & Basic Functionality

This phase focuses on establishing a functional Agno base within GLUE and ensuring basic workflows operate correctly. It's crucial to get this right as it forms the foundation for all subsequent work.

Priority 1: TDD: Setup Agno Base Integration (Task 1)

Importance: This is the absolute highest priority. It establishes the fundamental integration with Agno, allowing you to run Agno workflows from the GLUE CLI. Without this, no further integration is possible.
Steps:
RED: Create a new test file (e.g., tests/integration/test_agno_base.py) with a test function (e.g., test_basic_agno_workflow) that asserts that a minimal Agno workflow (e.g., a single agent with a simple task) can be initialized and executed via the GLUE CLI. This test should initially fail because the integration doesn't exist yet.
GREEN: Modify cli.py (specifically the glue run command or its equivalent) to:
Remove or comment out the existing GLUE-specific workflow initialization and execution logic.
Add minimal code to initialize and execute a basic Agno workflow (matching the one defined in your test) when glue run is invoked. This should be the simplest possible Agno setup to get the test passing.
REFACTOR: Clean up the initialization code in cli.py, ensuring it's well-structured and easy to understand. Consider extracting the Agno initialization logic into a separate function for clarity.
Priority 2: TDD: Integrate GLUE DSL Parser with Agno Config (Task 2)

Importance: This allows users to define Agno workflows using the familiar GLUE DSL, bridging the gap between the two frameworks.
Steps:
RED: Create or modify a test file (e.g., tests/unit/dsl/test_parser.py) with a test function (e.g., test_dsl_to_agno_config) that asserts that a basic GLUE DSL definition (e.g., defining an app, a team, and a model) can be correctly translated into an equivalent Agno configuration (e.g., a Workflow, a Team, and an Agent). The test should check that the generated Agno config has the expected structure and values.
GREEN: Implement the translation logic within dsl/parser.py (or a new module called by it) to parse the GLUE DSL and generate the corresponding Agno configuration. This logic should be sufficient to handle the basic DSL elements covered by your test.
REFACTOR: Clean up the translation code, ensuring it's modular, readable, and handles different DSL elements gracefully. Consider using a dedicated class or functions for specific parts of the translation process.
Priority 3: TDD: Update GLUE CLI (glue run) for Agno (Task 3)

Importance: This connects the DSL parsing to the execution engine, allowing users to run GLUE DSL-defined workflows on Agno.
Steps:
RED: Modify the integration test in tests/integration/test_agno_base.py (or create a new one, e.g., tests/integration/test_glue_run_with_dsl.py) to use a GLUE DSL file as input to the glue run command. The test should assert that the workflow defined in the DSL is correctly executed by Agno.
GREEN: Refactor the run_app function (or equivalent) in cli.py to:
Use the DSL parser (from Task 2) to translate the GLUE DSL input into an Agno configuration.
Instantiate the Agno Workflow and other necessary components based on the translated configuration.
Execute the Agno Workflow.
REFACTOR: Clean up the CLI command logic, ensuring it handles DSL input correctly and integrates smoothly with the Agno execution engine.
Phase 2: Feature Integration & Refinement

This phase focuses on integrating GLUE's unique features with the Agno core, ensuring they function as expected.

Priority 4: TDD: Implement GLUE Team Structure on Agno (Task 4)

Importance: Ensures that GLUE's team-based approach is correctly represented within Agno.
Steps:
RED: Write a test (e.g., in tests/integration/test_team_structure.py) that defines a GLUE DSL with a team containing multiple models (agents) and asserts that the resulting Agno setup has a corresponding Team with correctly configured Agents. The test should verify agent roles, names, and other relevant attributes.
GREEN: Modify the DSL translator (from Task 2) to ensure that when a GLUE team is defined in the DSL, the resulting Agno configuration includes a Team with Agents that accurately reflect the models and their properties.
REFACTOR: Clean up the team structure mapping code in the translator, making it robust and easy to maintain.
Priority 5: TDD: Implement Team-Based Tool Assignment (Task 5)

Importance: Preserves GLUE's ability to assign tools at the team level, simplifying configuration.
Steps:
RED: Write a test (e.g., in tests/integration/test_team_tools.py) that defines a GLUE DSL with a team that has tools assigned to it. The test should assert that the Agno Agents within that team can successfully access and use those tools during workflow execution.
GREEN: Implement the logic (likely within the DSL translator and/or Agno component initialization) to ensure that when tools are assigned to a team in the GLUE DSL, the corresponding Agno Agents inherit access to those tools. This might involve modifying how Agno Agents are configured or extending Agno's tool access mechanisms.
REFACTOR: Clean up the tool assignment and access code, ensuring it's efficient and well-integrated with Agno's tool handling.
Priority 6: TDD: Implement GLUE Adhesives on Agno Memory (Task 6)

Importance: This is crucial for managing tool output persistence and sharing, a key aspect of GLUE's design.
Steps:
RED: Write tests (e.g., in tests/integration/test_adhesives.py) that cover the behavior of GLUE's adhesive types (GLUE, VELCRO, TAPE) within the Agno environment. These tests should:
Define workflows that use tools with different adhesive types.
Assert that tool outputs are stored and retrieved correctly based on the adhesive type (e.g., GLUE-bound outputs are accessible to all team members, TAPE-bound outputs are not persisted).
GREEN: Implement the adhesive logic, likely involving:
Intercepting tool calls within the Agno workflow execution.
Using Agno's memory or storage mechanisms to store tool outputs.
Implementing retrieval logic that respects the adhesive type (e.g., checking agent permissions for GLUE-bound data, managing scopes for VELCRO).
REFACTOR: Clean up the adhesive implementation code, ensuring it's efficient, well-documented, and handles different adhesive types correctly. Consider creating a dedicated module or classes for adhesive management.
Phase 3: Advanced Features & Finalization

This phase tackles the most complex integration aspect and ensures the overall system is robust and user-ready.

Priority 7: TDD: Implement Magnetic Flow for Inter-Team Communication (Task 7)

Importance: This preserves GLUE's unique inter-team communication mechanism, a significant differentiator.
Steps:
RED: Write tests (e.g., in tests/integration/test_magnetic_flow.py) that define workflows with multiple teams and use the magnetize directive in the GLUE DSL to establish different communication patterns (PUSH, PULL, BIDIRECTIONAL, REPEL) between them. The tests should assert that:
Messages are correctly routed between teams based on the specified pattern.
Data is transformed or filtered as expected during communication.
The overall workflow execution proceeds correctly with inter-team communication.
GREEN: Implement the magnetic flow logic, which will likely involve:
Adapting GLUE's existing magnetic field system to work with Agno Teams.
Potentially extending Agno's Team or Workflow classes to incorporate the communication logic.
Integrating the communication mechanisms into the workflow execution process.
REFACTOR: Clean up the communication system code, ensuring it's well-integrated with Agno's core components and handles different communication patterns efficiently.
Priority 8: TDD: Verify/Update glue forge Functionality (Task 8)

Importance: Ensures that the component generation tool remains functional and produces code compatible with the new Agno-based system.
Steps:
RED: Write tests (e.g., in tests/integration/test_glue_forge.py) that use glue forge to generate custom components (tools, MCP integrations, etc.) and then verify that these generated components can be used within a GLUE workflow running on Agno. The tests should check for correct configuration, expected behavior, and compatibility with the Agno environment.
GREEN: Update the glue forge command and its associated templates to generate code that is compatible with the Agno-based GLUE framework. This might involve modifying the generated code structure, configuration files, or import statements.
REFACTOR: Clean up the forge code and templates, ensuring they are well-organized, easy to maintain, and produce consistent, high-quality output.
Priority 9: Integration Testing and Refinement (Task 9)

Importance: This is the final, critical step to ensure all components work together seamlessly and the integrated system is robust.
Steps:
GREEN: Write comprehensive integration tests that cover end-to-end scenarios, involving multiple components and features. These tests should simulate realistic user workflows and cover various use cases, including:
Complex DSL definitions with multiple teams, models, tools, and communication patterns.
Workflows that utilize different adhesive types and memory management strategies.
Error handling and edge cases.
REFACTOR: Based on the results of the integration tests, refine the integrated system. This might involve:
Fixing bugs or inconsistencies.
Optimizing performance.
Improving code clarity or documentation.
Addressing any remaining compatibility issues.
Key Considerations Throughout the Process:

TDD Discipline: Strictly adhere to the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for every task. This ensures that all code is test-driven and that the integration is robust from the outset.
Incremental Integration: Integrate Agno components and GLUE features incrementally, testing thoroughly after each step. This minimizes the risk of introducing regressions and makes debugging easier.
Clear Communication: Maintain clear communication within the development team, documenting changes, and addressing any challenges or roadblocks promptly.
Version Control: Use a robust version control system (like Git) to track changes, manage branches, and facilitate collaboration.
Documentation: Update documentation (e.g., in the docs/ directory) to reflect the Agno integration, including changes to CLI usage, DSL syntax (if any), and new features or limitations.
By following this plan, you'll systematically integrate Agno into GLUE, ensuring a robust, well-tested, and functional framework that leverages the strengths of both systems. Remember to adapt the plan as needed based on your progress and any unforeseen challenges.
