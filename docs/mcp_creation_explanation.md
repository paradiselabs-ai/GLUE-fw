Okay, let's break down how custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and tools can be integrated and used, clarifying my role in the process.

It's important to understand that I, Cline, **cannot directly create and run new MCP servers or tools solely from a prompt**. MCP servers are separate applications or scripts that need to be running on your local machine (or accessible network). They act as bridges, allowing me to interact with external systems, APIs, or custom logic that isn't built into my core capabilities.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the typical process for adding a new MCP capability, assuming a context-less environment:

1.  **Identifying the Need:** You (the user) determine that you need a new capability that I don't currently possess. This could be anything from interacting with a specific private API, accessing a local database, running a specialized calculation, or performing a unique file manipulation task.

2.  **Designing the MCP Server/Tool:**
    *   **Functionality:** You define precisely what the new tool should do. What inputs does it need? What output does it produce? Are there specific steps or logic involved?
    *   **Interface (Schema):** You design the input and output structure for the tool, typically using JSON Schema. This defines the parameters I need to provide when calling the tool (`use_mcp_tool`) and the format of the data I'll receive back.
    *   **Server Implementation:** You (or I can help guide you or even write the code with your approval) create the actual server application. This involves:
        *   Choosing a programming language and framework (e.g., Python with Flask/FastAPI, Node.js with Express).
        *   Writing the code that implements the tool's logic (e.g., making the API call, querying the database, performing the calculation).
        *   Setting up an HTTP server (or similar mechanism) that listens for requests from the system I run within.
        *   Parsing incoming requests (containing the tool name and arguments I provide).
        *   Executing the tool's logic.
        *   Formatting the results according to the defined output schema and sending them back.

3.  **My Role in Creation (Guidance & Code Generation):**
    *   **Planning:** If you ask me to help create it, I can assist in planning the server's structure, defining the schemas, and outlining the implementation steps.
    *   **Code Generation:** Based on the plan, I can generate the necessary code files (e.g., the server script, requirements file) using my file writing/editing tools (`write_to_file`, `replace_in_file`). This requires your explicit approval for each file operation.
    *   **Instructions:** I can provide the command-line instructions needed to install dependencies and run the server.

4.  **User's Role (Execution & Configuration):**
    *   **Environment Setup:** You need to ensure the necessary runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js) and dependencies are installed on your machine.
    *   **Running the Server:** You must start the MCP server process on your machine so it's actively listening for requests. This is typically done via a command line like `python your_mcp_server.py` or `node server.js`.
    *   **Registration/Configuration:** The system or framework you are using to interact with me needs to be configured to know about this new MCP server. This usually involves updating a configuration file or using a command to tell the system the server's name, address (e.g., `localhost:port`), and the tools/resources it provides. *This step is crucial and happens outside of my direct control.*

5.  **Interaction:**
    *   Once the MCP server is running and registered with the system, I can see it listed as an available MCP server.
    *   When you ask me to perform a task that requires the new capability, I can formulate a request using the `use_mcp_tool` tool, specifying the server name, tool name, and the required arguments based on the schema you defined.
    *   The system relays my request to your running MCP server.
    *   Your server processes the request and sends the result back.
    *   The system forwards the result to me, and I can then use that information to continue the task or provide you with the final answer.

**In Summary:**

Creating an MCP server isn't something I do "on the fly" in the sense of instantly materializing a running process. It's a collaborative software development process:

*   **You** identify the need, run the server, manage the environment, and configure the main system.
*   **I** can assist with planning, generating the code for the server (with your approval), providing instructions, and then *using* the tool once it's operational.

The power comes from this extensibility – MCP allows my capabilities to be augmented with custom logic and external integrations managed by you.

For the most detailed and official information on how to structure and build these servers according to the protocol specifications, I can load the relevant documentation for you.

*(MCP Documentation Loaded Here)*

Okay, I understand the documentation provided. It gives a great, concrete example of the workflow for creating an MCP server, specifically a Weather Server using TypeScript and OpenWeatherMap.

Based on your initial question and the documentation you provided, here's a refined and detailed explanation of how *we* (you and I working together) can create custom MCP servers and tools, clarifying my role and the necessary steps:

**Clarification: Not "On the Fly" Execution, but Collaborative Creation**

First, it's crucial to understand that I, Cline, don't *magically* create and run a new, independent server process just from a text prompt. MCP servers are separate applications that need to be:

1.  **Developed:** Code needs to be written.
2.  **Built/Compiled:** If necessary (like TypeScript to JavaScript).
3.  **Configured:** Set up with necessary environment variables (like API keys).
4.  **Executed:** Started as a process on your machine.
5.  **Registered:** Added to a configuration file so the system I run in knows how to communicate with it.

My role is primarily in steps 1, 2, and 5 – assisting with development, providing commands for building, and modifying the configuration file. Your role is crucial for steps 3 and 4 – providing necessary secrets and actually running the server process.

**Detailed Process (Illustrated by the Weather Server Example):**

1.  **Requirement & Design:**
    *   **You:** Identify the need for a new capability (e.g., "I want a tool to get weather forecasts").
    *   **We Collaborate:** We define the tool's specifics:
        *   **Name:** `get_forecast`
        *   **Functionality:** Fetch weather forecast from an external API (like OpenWeatherMap).
        *   **Inputs:** `city` (string, required), `days` (number, optional, 1-5).
        *   **Output:** JSON string containing forecast data.
        *   **Input Schema:** We define the JSON schema for the inputs (as shown in the example `index.ts`).

2.  **Scaffolding & Setup (My Assistance):**
    *   **Me:** I can suggest using a scaffolding tool if available (like `@modelcontextprotocol/create-server` mentioned in the docs).
    *   **Me:** I provide the necessary commands using `execute_command`:
        *(The command `cd /Users/cooper/Documents/Cline/MCP && npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server weather-server && cd weather-server && npm install axios` would be proposed here.)*

## 3. Implementation (Simulated)

*   **Cline Generates Code:** Based on the design from Step 2, Cline would generate the TypeScript code for the main server file (`src/index.ts`) in the `weather-server` project. This code implements the MCP server logic, including the 'get_forecast' tool handler, using the MCP SDK and axios for API calls.
*   **Cline Proposes File Write for index.ts:**
    ```typescript
    // Simulated content for /Users/cooper/Documents/Cline/MCP/weather-server/src/index.ts
    #!/usr/bin/env node
    import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js';
    import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';
    import {
      CallToolRequestSchema,
      ErrorCode,
      ListToolsRequestSchema,
      McpError,
    } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js';
    import axios from 'axios';

    // Retrieve API key from environment variable
    const API_KEY = process.env.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY;
    if (!API_KEY) {
      console.error('FATAL ERROR: OPENWEATHER_API_KEY environment variable is required but not set.');
      process.exit(1);
    }

    // Type guard for input validation
    const isValidForecastArgs = (args: any): args is { city: string; days?: number } =>
      typeof args === 'object' &&
      args !== null &&
      typeof args.city === 'string' &&
      (args.days === undefined || (typeof args.days === 'number' && args.days >= 1 && args.days <= 5));

    class WeatherServer {
      private server: Server;

      constructor() {
        this.server = new Server({
          name: 'weather-server',
          version: '0.1.0',
        }, {
          capabilities: {
            tools: {}, // Tools will be defined in handlers
          },
        });

        this.server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => ({
          tools: [{
            name: 'get_forecast',
            description: 'Retrieves the weather forecast for a specified city for up to 5 days.',
            inputSchema: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                city: { type: 'string', description: 'The name of the city.' },
                days: { type: 'number', description: 'Number of forecast days (1-5). Defaults to 3.', minimum: 1, maximum: 5 },
              },
              required: ['city'],
            },
          }],
        }));

        this.server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
          if (request.params.name !== 'get_forecast') {
            throw new McpError(ErrorCode.MethodNotFound, `Unknown tool: ${request.params.name}`);
          }

          if (!isValidForecastArgs(request.params.arguments)) {
            throw new McpError(ErrorCode.InvalidParams, 'Invalid arguments for get_forecast. Requires "city" and optional "days" (1-5).');
          }

          const { city, days = 3 } = request.params.arguments;
          const count = Math.min(days * 8, 40); // OpenWeatherMap forecast is in 3-hour intervals

          try {
            const response = await axios.get('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast', {
              params: { q: city, appid: API_KEY, cnt: count, units: 'metric' },
            });

            return {
              content: [{
                type: 'text',
                text: JSON.stringify(response.data, null, 2),
              }],
            };
          } catch (error) {
            if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
              return {
                content: [{
                  type: 'text',
                  text: `Error fetching forecast: ${error.response?.data?.message || error.message}`,
                }],
                isError: true,
              };
            }
            throw new McpError(ErrorCode.InternalError, 'Unexpected error in get_forecast tool.');
          }
        });

        this.server.onerror = (error) => console.error('[WeatherServer Error]', error);
      }

      async run() {
        const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
        await this.server.connect(transport);
        console.error('Weather MCP server running on stdio');
      }
    }

    const server = new WeatherServer();
    server.run().catch(console.error);
    ```

## 4. Building (Simulated)

*   **Cline Proposes Command:** After implementing the code, build the project to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
*   **Command:** `cd /Users/cooper/Documents/Cline/MCP/weather-server && npm run build`
*   **What Would Happen:** This compiles the code, creating an executable JavaScript file in the build directory.

## 5. Configuration and Secrets (Simulated)

*   **Cline Guides on Secrets:** Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and configure it.
*   **Registration:** Add the server to the MCP settings file with the API key.

## 6. Running and Testing (Simulated)

*   **User Runs Server:** Start the server process.
*   **Cline Uses Tool:** Invoke the new tool for testing.

## Cline's Internal Process for Handling MCP Requests

*   **Request Parsing:** When a user prompt involves creating or using MCP tools, I first parse the request to identify the intent, such as adding a new capability or modifying an existing one.
*   **Capability Check:** I assess if the task can be handled with existing tools or if a new MCP server is needed.
*   **Design and Planning:** I design the tool schema and server structure, then plan the steps for implementation.
*   **Tool Execution:** I use available tools like `write_to_file` or `execute_command` to assist in development, waiting for user approval and confirmation at each step.
*   **Iterative Development:** I proceed step-by-step, confirming each action before moving on, to ensure accuracy and collaboration.
