# Portkey Integration Strategy

## Current Approach (Alpha Release)

For the GLUE framework alpha release, we've implemented Portkey.ai integration as an **optional feature** that users can enable via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable Portkey integration
export PORTKEY_ENABLED=true

# Set Portkey API key
export PORTKEY_API_KEY=your_portkey_api_key
```

## Strategic Considerations

### Development Use

- We will use Portkey internally during development to track our own API usage, monitor costs, and optimize performance
- This will help us understand usage patterns and identify optimization opportunities
- Development metrics will inform future framework improvements

### User Access

- Portkey integration remains optional for all users in alpha and beta releases
- Basic documentation and examples are provided to help users get started
- No additional cost is imposed on users who choose to utilize Portkey

### Future Monetization Potential

- Consider partnering with Portkey for a revenue-sharing model in the future
- Potential "freemium" model where:
  - Basic Portkey integration remains free
  - Advanced features (custom routing rules, detailed analytics, etc.) could be part of a paid tier
- Any monetization would be implemented post-stable release

## Implementation Details

- The integration is designed to be non-intrusive
- Graceful fallback to direct provider calls if Portkey is unavailable
- No performance penalty for users who choose not to use Portkey

## Next Steps

1. Gather usage data during alpha and beta testing
2. Collect user feedback on the Portkey integration
3. Explore partnership opportunities with Portkey
4. Evaluate potential monetization strategies for post-1.0 releases
